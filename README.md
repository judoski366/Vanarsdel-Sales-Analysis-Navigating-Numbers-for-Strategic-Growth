## INTRODUCTION

VanArsdel is a well-known manufacturer and seller of sporting goods, operating in multiple regions, including the United States and various international markets. Their product portfolio includes items produced in-house as well as those sourced from other manufacturers. As a data analyst, I aim to analyze VanArsdel’s financial performance, focusing on the total cost of production, revenue generation, and profits. Additionally, I will examine the company’s customer distribution across different regions to uncover insights that could drive future business strategies using the six phase of data analysis.

## 2. Prepare

### Data Collection:

For this VanArsdel sales analysis project, data was sourced from Quantum Analytics, which provided a dataset consisting of 5 tables. The dataset contains a total of 30 columns and 89,411 rows of data. Below is an overview of each table:

### Sales Table: This table records all sales transactions and contains the following columns:
* customer ID: unique identifier for each customer.

* order date: the date when the order was placed.

* product ID: unique identifier for each product sold.

* ship date: the date when the order was shipped.

* units cost the cost per unit for the product.

* unit price: the price per unit charged to the customer.

* units: the number of units sold in each transaction.

### Product Table: This table provides detailed information about VanArsdel products, containing the following columns:

* catsegId: the identifier for the category segment.

* manufacturer: the name of the manufacturer.

* product: the name of the product.

* product id: the unique identifier for each product.

* units cost: the cost of manufacturing the product.

* unit price: the selling price of the product.

### Customer Table: This table holds information about each customer, with the following columns:

* customer id: unique identifier for each customer.

* first name: the first name of the customer..

* last name: the last name of the customer.

* email: the email address of the customer.

* zip code: the zip code of the customer’s residence.

### Category Segment Table: this table contains records of product segments, grouping them into categories with the following columns:

---

## 3.Process:

### Data Transformation:

To ensure that the data was ready for analysis, I first processed the raw CSV files provided by Quantum Analytics The key steps in this process included:

### Data Cleaning

* Checked for missing values and outliers across the dataset.

Verified that each column contained correctly formatted data (e.g., dates, numerical values, and text fields) to prevent errors during analysis.

* Ensured consistency in categorical fields such as `Category`, `Segment`, and `State` to maintain uniformity across the tables.

### Data Import
Once the data was cleaned and formatted properly, it was imported into Tableau from excel for further analysis and visualization.

### Data Integration (Joins)

* On Tableau I created inner joins to link the dimension tables (Product, Geography, Customer, and Category Segment) to the fact table (Sales). This allowed for seamless analysis across multiple attributes, such as customer location, product type, and sales performance. The key join relationships were based on the following:

* Sales and Product tables via Product ID.

* Sales and Customer tables via Customer ID.

* Sales and Geography tables via Zip code.

* Sales and Category Segment via Catsegid

### Measures Creation
I created calculated measures in Tableau to compute important metrics, including:

* Total Revenue: Derived by multiplying Units Sold by the Unit Price

* Total Cost: Calculated as Units Sold multiplied by the Unit Cost.

* Total Profit: The difference between Total Revenue and Total Cost.

This transformation process enabled the creation of accurate and insightful visualizations, leading to a comprehensive understanding of VanArsdel’s sales performance across different regions and product categories.

## 4. Analyze
Using the cleaned and transformed data, I conducted an analysis to extract key insights related to VanArsdel’s sales performance, customer distribution, and profitability. Here are the insights derived from the analysis.

### Key Insight:

#### Customer Distribution (Regional and State Levels)

![](https://github.com/judoski366/Vanarsdel-Sales-Analysis-Navigating-Numbers-for-Strategic-Growth/blob/main/customer%20dist%20chart.png)

* Regional Breakdown: VanArsdel customer base is primarily distributed across three regions: Central, East, and West. The Central region has the highest number of customers, followed by East and West.

#### State-Level Distribution:

![](https://github.com/judoski366/Vanarsdel-Sales-Analysis-Navigating-Numbers-for-Strategic-Growth/blob/main/customer%20map.PNG)

* States like California (12,023), Idaho (12,004), Indiana (11,577), Maryland (11,469), North Carolina (11,653), Kansas (11,196), New Mexico (11,105), and Wisconsin (11,016) host the largest customer bases for VanArsdel, contributing significantly to overall sales and customer engagement.


#### Profits Generated by Each State

![](https://github.com/judoski366/Vanarsdel-Sales-Analysis-Navigating-Numbers-for-Strategic-Growth/blob/main/Profit%20by%20state.png)


* States such as California, Texas, Florida, and Arizona not only have a higher number of customers but are also the most profitable states, generating substantial profits for VanArsdel.

* On the other hand, some states with a higher customer base, such as Indiana, Idaho, North Carolina, and Maryland, also had profit margins below $100k, contributing their quota to overall revenue.


#### Top Revenue-Generating Product

![](https://github.com/judoski366/Vanarsdel-Sales-Analysis-Navigating-Numbers-for-Strategic-Growth/blob/main/product%20by%20profits.png)


* The product that generated the most revenue across VanArsdel’s entire catalog is the Maximum-UM54 and Maximum-UM11, generating over $2 million. This high-end product has consistently driven sales, especially in the United States, contributing a large portion to the company’s total revenue. Additionally, from the chart, we can see that most products generated over $100k in revenue.


#### Top Product by Units Sold

![](https://github.com/judoski366/Vanarsdel-Sales-Analysis-Navigating-Numbers-for-Strategic-Growth/blob/main/Product%20by%20units.png)


* The VanArsdel Maximus UM-54 and VanArsdel Maximus UM-11 hold the top spot for the most units sold over 200+. This indicates a strong customer preference for affordable and high-performance sports footwear. The product’s popularity extends across all other regions.


#### Bottom Performing Product by Quantity Sold

![](https://github.com/judoski366/Vanarsdel-Sales-Analysis-Navigating-Numbers-for-Strategic-Growth/blob/main/Bottom%20profits%20by%20product.png)


* Upon closer examination of the data, it is evident that the majority of other products sold fewer than 40 units in total, indicating a substantial disparity when compared to the high-performing Maximus-12, which sold over 80 units. The low-performing products had difficulty reaching the 40-unit benchmark, suggesting a potential opportunity for enhancing product offerings or implementing more effective marketing strategies to increase sales.

#### What are the profits generated across all product categories?

![](https://github.com/judoski366/Vanarsdel-Sales-Analysis-Navigating-Numbers-for-Strategic-Growth/blob/main/profits%20by%20categories.png)


* The total profits generated across all product categories show significant variation. Accessories contributed $1.061 million, while the mix product category under the All-Season segment earned $171,000. Convenience products brought in $383,000. The urban product category performed exceptionally well, particularly in the Extreme segment, with $14.622 million in profits, while the Moderation segment brought in a more modest $14,000. Productivity products generated the highest overall profits, reaching $104.507 million. On the lower end, the regular segment under urban products was the weakest performer, earning just $1,000. Youth products, meanwhile, generated $139,000. These figures illustrate a broad range of profitability across product categories and segments.


![](https://github.com/judoski366/Vanarsdel-Sales-Analysis-Navigating-Numbers-for-Strategic-Growth/blob/main/Profits%20by%20year.png)

* Highest Profit Year: The highest profit year was 2013, with total profits peaking at $11,316,660, indicating a strong performance during this period. This peak was likely driven by successful product launches, market expansion, or other favorable factors that boosted revenue.

* Lowest Profit Year: The lowest profit year was 2016, when profits dropped significantly to $1,722,260, marking a sharp decline from previous years. This drastic fall could suggest challenges such as increased competition, market downturns, higher costs, or decreased demand. The steady decline from 2013 onwards signals potential issues that need to be addressed to regain profitability.

## 6. Act

#### Recommendations

* **Focus on Top Performers:** Invest in marketing and inventory for the top 20 products generating the most profits. Consider bundling these items with complementary products to increase sales further.

* **Re-evaluate Underperformers:** Analyze the least performing products by quantity sold to determine if they should be discontinued or if their marketing strategies need revamping. Consider gathering customer feedback to understand why these products aren’t selling well.

* **Target High-Profit States:** Develop targeted marketing strategies and sales promotions in the states generating the highest profits. This could include regional advertisements, localized promotions, or partnerships with local retailers.

* **Expand in Low-Performing Regions:** Conduct market research in regions with low customer distribution and profits to understand barriers to sales. This could involve adjusting pricing strategies, enhancing distribution channels, or increasing local engagement.

* **Explore New Market Segments:** Analyze revenue across different market segments to identify potential areas for growth. Consider diversifying product offerings to cater to underrepresented segments or emerging markets.

* **Customer Feedback Initiatives:** Establish a system for gathering customer feedback on products and services. Use surveys and social media engagement to understand customer preferences and pain points.
Loyalty Programs: Develop loyalty programs or promotions for repeat customers to increase retention rates. This could include discounts, exclusive access to new products, or rewards for referrals.

* **Profit-Centric Strategies:** Shift focus from solely increasing sales volume to also considering profitability. This may involve reducing costs associated with low-margin products and enhancing the profitability of high-margin items.
